## Question 2:

What is the primary difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs)?

- A) Security Groups operate at the subnet level, while NACLs operate at the instance level.
  - Incorrect: Security Groups operate at the instance level, while NACLs operate at the subnet level.
- B) Security Groups support both allow and deny rules, while NACLs only support allow rules.
  - Incorrect: Security Groups only support allow rules, while NACLs support both allow and deny rules.
- C) Security Groups are stateful, while NACLs are stateless.
  - Correct: Security Groups are stateful, meaning they track the state of connections, while NACLs are stateless and do not track connections.
- D) NACLs operate at the instance level, while Security Groups operate at the subnet level.
  - Incorrect: NACLs operate at the subnet level, while Security Groups operate at the instance level.

## Question 3:

Which type of VPC Endpoint is used for connecting to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB?

- A) Interface Endpoint
  - Incorrect: Interface Endpoints are used for most AWS services other than S3 and DynamoDB.
- B) Gateway Endpoint
  - Correct: Gateway Endpoints are used specifically for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
- C) Transit Gateway
  - Incorrect: Transit Gateway is used for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
- D) Direct Connect
  - Incorrect: Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS.

## Question 4:

What is the purpose of VPC Flow Logs?

- A) To capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
  - Correct: VPC Flow Logs capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- B) To manage routing tables within a VPC.
  - Incorrect: VPC Flow Logs do not manage routing tables; they capture traffic information.
- C) To create static IP addresses for instances.
  - Incorrect: VPC Flow Logs do not create static IP addresses; Elastic IPs are used for that purpose.
- D) To monitor the performance of AWS services.
  - Incorrect: VPC Flow Logs are used for monitoring network traffic, not service performance.

## Question 5:

Which AWS service allows for private connections between your VPC and AWS services without requiring internet access?

- A) VPC Peering
  - Incorrect: VPC Peering connects two VPCs but does not provide private access to AWS services.
- B) VPC Endpoints
  - Correct: VPC Endpoints allow for private connections between your VPC and AWS services without requiring internet access.
- C) Site-to-Site VPN
  - Incorrect: Site-to-Site VPN connects your on-premises network to AWS.
- D) AWS Direct Connect
  - Incorrect: AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS.

## Question 6:

Which of the following is a feature of AWS Private Link?

- A) Provides a public IP for secure access to services across VPCs.
  - Incorrect: AWS Private Link does not use public IPs; it ensures that traffic does not traverse the public internet.
- B) Allows secure, private access to AWS services across different VPCs.
  - Correct: AWS Private Link allows secure, private access to AWS services across different VPCs without using public IPs.
- C) Facilitates routing of traffic between VPCs using internet gateways.
  - Incorrect: AWS Private Link does not use internet gateways for routing traffic.
- D) Uses NAT gateways to secure data transfer within VPCs.
  - Incorrect: NAT gateways are not a feature of AWS Private Link.

## Question 7:

Which connectivity solution is best suited for organizations requiring consistent high-speed connectivity and lower latency?

- A) Site-to-Site VPN
  - Incorrect: Site-to-Site VPN provides secure connectivity over the internet but does not offer the same consistency and low latency as Direct Connect.
- B) AWS Direct Connect
  - Correct: AWS Direct Connect provides consistent high-speed connectivity and lower latency compared to internet-based connections.
- C) VPC Peering
  - Incorrect: VPC Peering connects VPCs within the same or different accounts but does not address high-speed, low-latency connectivity from on-premises networks.
- D) AWS Client VPN
  - Incorrect: AWS Client VPN provides secure remote access but does not offer the same high-speed connectivity as Direct Connect.

## Question 8:

What are the benefits of using AWS Transit Gateway?

- A) Simplifies the network architecture by acting as a central hub for connectivity.
  - Correct: AWS Transit Gateway simplifies the network architecture by acting as a central hub for connectivity between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
- B) Provides public IP addresses for all connected resources.
  - Incorrect: AWS Transit Gateway does not provide public IP addresses; it facilitates private connectivity.
- C) Enhances security by encrypting all data transfers between VPCs.
  - Incorrect: AWS Transit Gateway does not inherently encrypt data transfers; security mechanisms must be configured separately.
- D) Replaces the need for all security groups and NACLs.
  - Incorrect: AWS Transit Gateway does not replace security groups and NACLs; these still need to be managed for security.

## Question 9:

Which AWS service uses the OpenVPN protocol for secure remote access to AWS resources?

- A) AWS Site-to-Site VPN
  - Incorrect: Site-to-Site VPN connects on-premises networks to AWS.
- B) AWS Client VPN
  - Correct: AWS Client VPN uses the OpenVPN protocol for secure remote access to AWS resources.
- C) AWS Direct Connect
  - Incorrect: AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection but does not use the OpenVPN protocol.
- D) AWS Transit Gateway
  - Incorrect: AWS Transit Gateway facilitates network connectivity but does not provide remote access using OpenVPN.

## Question 10:

How do NAT Gateways enhance the security of instances in private subnets?

- A) By allowing direct inbound traffic from the internet.
  - Incorrect: NAT Gateways do not allow direct inbound traffic from the internet; they facilitate outbound traffic from private instances.
- B) By enabling instances in private subnets to connect to the internet while blocking inbound connections.
  - Correct: NAT Gateways allow instances in private subnets to connect to the internet for updates or downloads while blocking inbound connections, enhancing security.
- C) By providing public IP addresses to private instances.
  - Incorrect: NAT Gateways do not provide public IP addresses; they facilitate outbound traffic using a single public IP.
- D) By encrypting all traffic between private instances and the internet.
  - Incorrect: NAT Gateways do not encrypt traffic; they route traffic securely without exposing private instances to direct inbound connections.
