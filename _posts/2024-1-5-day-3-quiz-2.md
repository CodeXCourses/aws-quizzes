## Question 1:

Which S3 Storage Class is most cost-effective for archiving data that does not need immediate retrieval?

- A) Amazon Glacier

  - Incorrect: While Glacier is cost-effective, Glacier Deep Archive is specifically designed for data that can be archived for long periods with no immediate retrieval requirement.

- B) Amazon Glacier Deep Archive

  - Correct: Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest-cost storage class designed for data that is rarely accessed.

- C) Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access

  - Incorrect: S3 Standard-IA is for infrequently accessed data, but not as cost-effective as Glacier Deep Archive for archival.

- D) Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering
  - Incorrect: Intelligent Tiering optimizes costs based on access patterns but is not the best for long-term archiving.

## Question 2:

What is an Amazon S3 bucket?

- A) Buckets are containers for storing objects in S3.

  - Correct: Buckets store objects, which can include data and metadata.

- B) Files

  - Incorrect: S3 stores objects, not traditional file systems.

- C) Documents

  - Incorrect: While documents can be stored, they are part of objects in S3.

- D) Folders
  - Incorrect: S3 uses a flat storage system with objects and buckets.

## Question 3:

Which hybrid AWS service enables on-premises servers to utilize AWS Cloud storage seamlessly?

- A) Elastic Block Store

  - Incorrect: EBS provides block storage for EC2 instances but does not integrate on-premises storage.

- B) Snowball

  - Incorrect: Snowball is used for data transfer, not for hybrid cloud storage.

- C) S3

  - Incorrect: S3 is for object storage but does not integrate on-premises storage directly.

- D) Storage Gateway
  - Correct: Storage Gateway allows on-premises servers to use AWS Cloud storage seamlessly.

## Question 4:

Which service is designed for moving petabyte-scale data into and out of AWS with computing capabilities?

- A) Snowcone

  - Incorrect: Snowcone is used for smaller data transfers.

- B) Snowball Edge

  - Correct: Snowball Edge can transfer large amounts of data and offers compute capabilities.

- C) Snowmobile
  - Incorrect: Snowmobile is used for exabyte-scale data transfers.

## Question 5:

What is the definition of Lifecycle Rules in Amazon S3?

- A) Policies for controlling user access

  - Incorrect: These are Bucket Policies.

- B) Rules for managing the lifecycle of objects in S3 storage classes

  - Correct: Lifecycle Rules define actions to transition objects between storage classes based on specific conditions.

- C) Procedures for backing up data

  - Incorrect: This describes backup policies.

- D) Methods for encrypting data
  - Incorrect: This refers to encryption policies.

## Question 6:

True or False: Amazon S3 objects are composed of a key, value, and metadata.

- A) True

  - Correct: S3 objects consist of a key (unique identifier), value (the data), and metadata (additional information about the object).

- B) False
  - Incorrect: This statement is true. S3 objects have these components.

## Question 7:

Which AWS service should be used to transfer exabyte-scale data to and from AWS?

- A) Snowcone

  - Incorrect: Snowcone is for smaller data transfers.

- B) Snowball Edge

  - Incorrect: Snowball Edge is for petabyte-scale transfers.

- C) Snowmobile

  - Correct: Snowmobile is designed for exabyte-scale data transfers.

## Question 8:

Which AWS service can a research team with limited internet connectivity use to transfer 5 TB of data to the cloud?

- A) Storage Gateway

  - Incorrect: Storage Gateway is for hybrid storage integration.

- B) Snowball Edge

  - Incorrect: Snowball Edge is for larger data transfers and includes compute capabilities.

- C) Snowcone

  - Correct: Snowcone is ideal for transferring smaller amounts of data, like 5 TB, in low-connectivity environments.

- D) OpsHub
  - Incorrect: OpsHub is a software tool for managing Snow Family devices, not the device itself.

## Question 9:

Which S3 Storage Class is best for data that is infrequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed, with high durability and support for Availability Zone failure?

- A) Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose

  - Incorrect: This is for frequently accessed data.

- B) Amazon Glacier

  - Incorrect: Glacier is for long-term archiving with longer retrieval times.

- C) Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

  - Incorrect: This does not provide Availability Zone failure protection.

- D) Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
  - Correct: S3 Standard-IA is suitable for infrequently accessed data that still needs rapid access and durability.

## Question 10:

Which AWS service can efficiently transfer large data volumes to the cloud while providing local computing capacity?

- A) Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized

  - Correct: Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized can handle large data transfers and provides local compute capabilities.

- B) Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized

  - Incorrect: This variant focuses more on compute capacity than storage.

- C) Snowcone

  - Incorrect: Snowcone is for smaller data transfers and limited compute.

- D) Snowmobile
  - Incorrect: Snowmobile is for the largest data transfers, typically exabyte-scale.
