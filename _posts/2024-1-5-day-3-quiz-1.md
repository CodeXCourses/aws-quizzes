## Question 1:

What is the primary goal of ensuring High Availability in cloud environments?

- A) Enhance application performance

  - Incorrect: While performance is important, High Availability focuses on ensuring applications continue running during disruptions.

- B) Application resilience during failures

  - Correct: High Availability aims to keep applications running smoothly even in the event of disasters.

- C) Improve user accessibility across devices

  - Incorrect: High Availability is more concerned with uptime and resilience than device accessibility.

- D) Scale applications by adding more instances as needed
  - Incorrect: This describes scalability, not High Availability.

## Question 2:

To manage numerous connections with minimal delay, which AWS Load Balancer should you select?

- A) Application Load Balancer

  - Incorrect: This is optimized for HTTP/HTTPS traffic but may not handle numerous connections with the lowest latency.

- B) Network Load Balancer

  - Correct: Network Load Balancer is designed for high-performance and low-latency connections.

- C) Elastic Load Balancer
  - Incorrect: This is a general term for AWS Load Balancers and not a specific type.

## Question 3:

Upgrading an EC2 instance from t3a.medium to t3a.2xlarge exemplifies what type of scaling?

- A) Horizontal scaling

  - Incorrect: Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances, not changing the size of an instance.

- B) High Availability

  - Incorrect: High Availability ensures uptime, not scaling methods.

- C) Agility

  - Incorrect: Agility refers to the ability to rapidly adapt to changes, not scaling specifics.

- D) Vertical scaling
  - Correct: Vertical scaling increases the resources of a single instance.

## Question 4:

What service can dynamically adjust the number of compute resources to match the traffic load on your application?

- A) Elastic Load Balancer

  - Incorrect: This distributes incoming traffic but does not adjust the number of resources.

- B) A larger instance type

  - Incorrect: Upgrading to a larger instance is a manual change, not an automatic adjustment.

- C) Auto Scaling Group

  - Correct: Auto Scaling Groups can automatically increase or decrease the number of instances based on load.

- D) Health Checks on your EC2 Instances
  - Incorrect: Health checks monitor instance health but do not scale resources.

## Question 5:

Which statement about Auto Scaling Groups is false?

- A) Replace unhealthy instances

  - Incorrect: Auto Scaling Groups do replace unhealthy instances.

- B) Optimize costs by maintaining optimal capacity

  - Incorrect: They help manage costs by running the optimal number of instances.

- C) Register new instances with load balancers automatically

  - Incorrect: They can register new instances with load balancers.

- D) Automatically change EC2 instance types
  - Correct: Auto Scaling Groups do not automatically change the instance types; they adjust the number of instances.

## Question 6:

For HTTP/HTTPS traffic management, which Load Balancer is ideal?

- A) Network Load Balancer

  - Incorrect: Network Load Balancer is best for handling numerous connections with low latency but not specifically optimized for HTTP/HTTPS.

- B) Classic Load Balancer

  - Incorrect: Classic Load Balancer is older and less efficient for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

- C) Elastic Load Balancer

  - Incorrect: This is a general term, not a specific type.

- D) Application Load Balancer
  - Correct: Application Load Balancer is designed specifically for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

## Question 7:

Which one is not a valid Auto Scaling strategy?

- A) Manual Scaling

  - Incorrect: Manual Scaling is a valid strategy where you manually adjust the number of instances.

- B) Dynamic Scaling

  - Incorrect: Dynamic Scaling adjusts the number of instances based on real-time metrics.

- C) Active Scaling

  - Correct: Active Scaling is not a recognized Auto Scaling strategy.

- D) Predictive Scaling
  - Incorrect: Predictive Scaling uses historical data to forecast and adjust the number of instances.

## Question 8:

Which AWS service does not facilitate horizontal scaling of compute resources?

- A) EBS

  - Correct: EBS is a block storage service, not for scaling compute resources.

- B) Auto Scaling Group

  - Incorrect: Auto Scaling Groups enable horizontal scaling by adjusting the number of instances.

- C) EC2

  - Incorrect: EC2 instances are part of the infrastructure that can be scaled horizontally.

- D) Elastic Load Balancing

  - Incorrect: Elastic Load Balancing helps distribute traffic, which supports horizontal scaling.

## Question 9:

Which of the following is a function of Load Balancers?

- A) Automatically scale backend instances

  - Incorrect: Load Balancers do not handle backend scaling; that is the role of Auto Scaling Groups.

- B) Conduct regular health checks on instances

  - Correct: Load Balancers perform regular health checks to ensure instances are healthy.

- C) Manage DNS records for instances

  - Incorrect: Managing DNS records is not a function of Load Balancers.

- D) Handle SSL/TLS encryption

  - Incorrect: While Load Balancers can offload SSL/TLS, the primary function is traffic distribution and health checking.

## Question 10:

Ensuring applications remain operational during disruptions is a characteristic of which cloud principle?

- A) Performance optimization

  - Incorrect: This focuses on improving application speed and efficiency.

- B) High Availability

  - Correct: High Availability ensures applications remain accessible during failures.

- C) Scalability

  - Incorrect: Scalability relates to adjusting resources to meet demand, not ensuring uptime.

- D) Cost efficiency
  - Incorrect: Cost efficiency focuses on minimizing expenses, not maintaining uptime.
